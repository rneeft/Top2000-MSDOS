<p>
    On the detail's screen, more statistic information is displayed for the given track. You will find the title, the artist name and the year on which the track was recorded. All the appearances, since the first edition in 1999 are listed horizontally. Each icon indicates whether the track has gained or lost in position, made a comeback to the list, was newly added or wasn't displayed at all.
</p>
<p>
    The total amount of appearances are shown in two different rows. The first row displays the number of times the track was listed in comparison to the number of times it could have been listed. For example, Oceaan from Racoon was released in 2013 and have been voted in for the Top2000 list ever since. The second row shows the number of times the track was listed since the start of the TOP2000 back in 1999.
</p>
<p>
    In the last section, the highest/lowest and the first/last appearances of the track is displayed. When the track is listed in the latest edition, then the date and time is also shown, during which the track is aired (CET-time).
